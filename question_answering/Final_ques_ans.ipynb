              " ' 911\\n\\n    Context: The Duchy of Normandy was founded in 911, when the Duchy of Normandy was founded by the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and the famed Viking ruler Rollo, and was situated in the former Frankish kingdom of Neustria. The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further Viking incursions. The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to the river Seine, but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine.

A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem X can be solved using an algorithm for Y, X is no more difficult than Y, and we say that X reduces to Y.

Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than k. No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the RSA algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in NP and in co-NP (and even in UP and co-UP). If the problem is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., NP will equal co-NP). The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve, which takes time O(e(64/9)1/3(n.log 2)1/3(log (n.log 2))2/3) to factor an n-bit integer.

He showed that a set of strings is rudimentary if and only if it is a subset of the set of strings generated by a Turing machine with a bounded number of states.

              " ' The answer is: Stephen Cook, Leonid Levin and Richard Karp. The speed-up theorem is a result in the field of complexity theory. It states that if a problem is NP-complete, then it is also NP-hard. This means that it is possible to solve the problem in polynomial time, but it is not possible to solve it in polynomial time. This is a very important result in the field of complexity theory, because it shows that there are problems that are NP-complete, but not NP-hard. This means that it is possible to solve the problem in polynomial time, but it is not possible to solve it in polynomial time.
